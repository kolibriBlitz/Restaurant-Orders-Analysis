|:-----------:|---------------------------------------|
| `SELECT`    | [e.g., Retrieve specific columns]       |

| `GROUP BY`  | [e.g., Aggregate data for analysis]     |
| `ORDER BY`  | [e.g., Sort data by values]             |
| `CROSS JOIN`      | [Optional – remove if not used]         |

- [Insert interesting findings or things you noticed while writing queries]
- [E.g., Edamame appears frequently as a solo item]
- [E.g., Italian dishes have higher average price than others]

## Notes or Challenges
- [Optional section – mention any errors, unexpected results, or lessons learned]
- [E.g., Needed to use `DISTINCT` to get unique counts]
