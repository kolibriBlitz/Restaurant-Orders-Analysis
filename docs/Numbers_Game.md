# Exercise 7 – Percentages Are Where It's At

## Goals
- [List specific learning or project goals for this exercise]
- [E.g., explore the menu_items table, practice joins, analyze patterns]

## Skills Practiced
| Command     | Purpose                                |
|:-----------:|---------------------------------------|
| `SELECT`    | Retrieve specific columns      |
| `SUM`   | [e.g., Filter rows based on conditions] |

|`ROUND`||
| `GROUP BY`  | e.g., Aggregate data for analysis    |
| `ORDER BY`  | e.g., Sort data by values           |
| `CROSS JOIN`      |         |
|`CREATE`...`FUNCTION`|Create a stored routine to return a query value|
|`INT`/`DECIMAL`|Data types|

## Key Observations
- [Insert interesting findings or things you noticed while writing queries]
- [E.g., Edamame appears frequently as a solo item]
- [E.g., Italian dishes have higher average price than others]

## Notes or Challenges
- [Optional section – mention any errors, unexpected results, or lessons learned]
- [E.g., Needed to use `DISTINCT` to get unique counts]
- [E.g., Originally forgot to exclude NULL item_ids]
