# Once Upon a Time – We know *what* they're eating, but what about ***when***

## Goals
- [List specific learning or project goals for this exercise]
- [E.g., explore the menu_items table, practice joins, analyze patterns]

## Skills Practiced
| Command     | Purpose                                |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `SELECT`    | [e.g., Retrieve specific columns]       |
| `WHERE`     | [e.g., Filter rows based on conditions] |
| `GROUP BY`  | [e.g., Aggregate data for analysis]     |
| `ORDER BY`  | [e.g., Sort data by values]             |
| `JOIN`      | [Optional – remove if not used]         |

## Key Observations
- [Insert interesting findings or things you noticed while writing queries]
- [E.g., Edamame appears frequently as a solo item]
- [E.g., Italian dishes have higher average price than others]

## Notes or Challenges
- [Optional section – mention any errors, unexpected results, or lessons learned]
- [E.g., Needed to use `DISTINCT` to get unique counts]
- [E.g., Originally forgot to exclude NULL item_ids]
