# Data Visualization

## Goals
- Create a dashboard that tells short stories about sale trends over time and the relationships between item price, orders and sales.
- Design visuals for any audience.
- Layout visuals in a readable style meant to be reviewed on the go.

## Skills Practiced
- Uploaded data from CSV files.
- Organized data relationships in Data Source View.
- Engineered calculated columns.
- Created a custom filter from a parameter.
- Created sets and hierarchies.
- Analyzed a scatterplot using clusters and turned clusters into a group.
- Prepared visuals in Tableau.
- Exporting Tableau visualizations for:
  - stakeholders who may not have access to Power BI desktop
  - stakeholders to have as a portable reference

## Notes and Challenges
- Tableau's order of operations can cause all sorts of surprises!
- So many options, so little time.
  - Also, check yo'self befo' yo' wreck yo'self...does adding X make the visualization better? ðŸ¤”
- Compared to Power BI, I feel that Tableau is more user-friendly and intuitive but it has less granular formatting options.
