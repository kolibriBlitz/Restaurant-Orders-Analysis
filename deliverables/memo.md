# Dealing With Discrepancies

While cleaning the restaurant data, I discovered 137 orders without a menu_item_id. I checked for consistent or reliable patterns to impute values but didn't find any. <br>
To prevent this from becoming a larger issue in future reports, I documented the missing data and contacted the data steward. <br>
I requested a .CSV file containing the correct item ID, item name, category, and price. <br>
Expected result: Receipt of complete data by the deadline I provided.
