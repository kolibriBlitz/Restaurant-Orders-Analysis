# Dealing With Discrepancies
While cleaning the restaurant data, I came across 137 orders without a menu_item_id. I checked for the existence of consistent or reliable patterns to use for value imputation, but there weren't any. <br>
I want to address this now before it grows into a larger problem. <br>
I will write a memo/short email to the data steward explaining the situation and requesting complete data. I don't know them very well yet.<br>
Expected result: I receive the data I requested by the deadline I set.
