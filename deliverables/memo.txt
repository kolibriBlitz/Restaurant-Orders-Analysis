Hello Data Dude,

In reviewing the order data, I found several orders missing an item ID. 

I've attached a list of those orders for your records.

Please find out what item(s) were sold. Can you deliver a list of the items with item ID, item name, category and price as a .CSV to me by the end of the week please?

Thanks,

Melisande Fritzsche
