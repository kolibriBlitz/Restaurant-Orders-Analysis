Subject: Missing item_ids in Q1 order data


Hello Avery,

While reviewing the Q1 order data, I found 137 orders missing an item_ID. I've attached a list of those records for reference.

Could find out what item(s) were sold in these orders? I'll need the item id, item name, category and price for each.

Please send me the data as a .CSV file by the end of the week.

I appreciate your help!

Thanks,

Melisande Fritzsche
