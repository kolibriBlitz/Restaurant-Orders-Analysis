# SQL_Projects
## Restaurant Orders

### Project Goals
- Practice SQL skills through hands-on, iterative querying.
- Think like a business analyst by looking for patterns, spotting anomalies, and turning data into actionable strategies.
- Advise a fictional restaurant owner on ways to **increase revenue** and **boost orders**.

### Methodology
1. Getting to know you: Explored data to see what data exists and get a feel for possible paths of investigation.
2. Bath time: Check data for anomalies and missing data to ensure accurate results.
3. Introduced a time element: Analyzed order timestamps to identify revenue-driving periods.
4. Investigated low-ticket orders: Looked at low-value purchases to see if they offered untapped opportunity.
5. Observed popularity trends: Identified most-ordered dishes and cuisines to inform menu strategy.

### Results and Insights
**⏰Time-Based Trends**
-* 🤑“We make money on payday.”*
  - High-ticket orders cluster around a 2-hour window in the first, middle, and last weeks of each month—likely correlating with paydays.
- Surprisingly **no spike** near Valentine’s Day, signaling a missed marketing opportunity (e.g., a prix fixe dinner, couples' event, etc.).

**👇🏼 Low-End Orders**
-*“If a bug could accelerate fast enough, it could crack a windshield.”*
  - Edamame shows up often as a solo order—customers love it.
  - Suggests a segment of price-conscious or snack-focused buyers.

**Opportunity:** Offer more inexpensive Asian side dishes, or use edamame in bundled promos (e.g., “Buy an entrée, get edamame for $1”, "Buy 2 edamame, get 1 half off", etc.).

**🍝🍣🌮🍔 Menu Popularity**
